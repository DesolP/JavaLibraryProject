# JavaLibraryProject

Library project containing all required methods that library should have.

It's connected to real local mySQL library, so all declared methods really do what they should.

Program is working using IntellIJ console window, GUI not created, but it can be done.
Help option allows user to see all possible operations with short descriptions. 


It will also contain user verification with assigning different user levels (regular user, super user, admin). Since it's not done yet, every user has all privileges.

Project still under development.
